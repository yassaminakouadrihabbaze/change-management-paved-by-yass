# Hotfix Workflow

"🚨 Starting hotfix process. This is for urgent production issues only."

## Step 1: Branch from main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/$ARGUMENTS
```

## Step 2: Understand the issue
Ask the user: "Describe the production issue. What's broken, and what's the user impact?"

## Step 3: Fix
Implement the minimal fix. Do not refactor, do not add features. Fix only the issue.
Explain: "I'm making the smallest possible change to fix this. We can improve the code in a proper feature branch later."

## Step 4: Fast-track validation
Run the project's quality gates — **lint, type-check, tests, build** — using the commands listed under **Key Commands** in @docs/architecture/tech-stack.md (default Next.js stack: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`).

Skip product/architecture review — this is a targeted fix.

## Step 5: Commit and guide merge
Commit with: `fix(scope): description of hotfix`

**Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` or any AI-attribution trailer** in the commit message (per CLAUDE.md workflow rule #7).

Tell the user:
"✅ Hotfix committed. To deploy:
1. `git push origin hotfix/$ARGUMENTS`
2. Create PR to main and merge
3. Your CI/CD auto-deploys to production on merge (see @docs/development/git-workflow.md)

After merging, consider: does this fix need a proper backlog item for a better long-term solution?"
